# Changelog

## 2.0.0 (Unreleased) — Bytes v2

This is a **major** release that overhauls Bytes system prompts and sub-agent
behaviour to bring them closer to AmpCode-grade quality, and **fixes the main
pain point**: Librarian was previously over-eager to fire on phrases like
"research" / "tìm hiểu" / "investigate" even for trivial single-source lookups.

### Migration guide (breaking changes)

1. **Explore output format changed** from custom XML wrappers
   (`<results>`, `<files>`, `<answer>`, `<next_steps>`) to plain Markdown with
   fluent `file://` links. If you had downstream code that parsed the XML
   format you must switch to parsing the Markdown bullet list. The new shape:

   ```text
   <one- to two-sentence summary>

   - [src/auth/login.ts#L42-L80](file:///abs/repo/src/auth/login.ts#L42-L80) — short reason
   - …

   <optional 1-line next step>
   ```

2. **Bytes overlay grew** from ~4.3 KB to ~10–11 KB rendered (still under the
   12 KB budget). Sections added:
   - `identity`
   - `autonomy_and_persistence`
   - `investigate_before_acting`
   - `tool_use_protocol`
   - `verification_contract`
   - `executing_actions_with_care`
   - `markdown_format`
   - `file_references`
   - `final_status_spec`

   The legacy XML wrapper tag `<agency>` (Claude variant) was renamed to
   `<precedence>` to match the section key. If you scraped the prompt for
   `<agency>` you must update to `<precedence>`.

3. **New `kimi` model family.** `model.family` may now be `"kimi"` for
   Kimi/Moonshot models. The default routing remains `claude → default.ts`,
   `gpt → gpt.ts`, `gemini → gemini.ts`, plus the new `kimi → kimi.ts`.

4. **Librarian gating is now strict.** Calls that previously succeeded on
   single-URL fetches, single-library docs lookups, single-GitHub searches,
   or local-codebase questions are now explicitly listed as anti-patterns in
   both the tool description and the Bytes overlay. See "Phase 1.6" below.

### Phase 0 — Baseline

- Added `scripts/snapshot-prompts.ts`: dumps per-agent character count,
  section count, and top headings for every builtin sub-agent + every Bytes
  overlay variant. Used as the v1 → v2 baseline.
- Added 6 librarian-gating fixtures (L1–L6) in
  `src/sub-agents/__tests__/librarian-gating.test.ts`. Each fixture exercises
  a representative request and asserts the rendered guidance + tool
  description correctly classify it as `delegate` or `direct`. All 6
  fixtures pass after the Phase 1.6 fix.
- Baseline metrics (rendered chars):
  - Pre-rework: claude/other 4317, gpt 4342, gemini 4224, kimi n/a.
  - Post-rework: claude/other 10111, gpt 10430, gemini 10636, kimi 9853.
  - Gzip package size: 107 KB (well under 500 KB budget).

### Phase 1.6 — Librarian gating hardening (PRIORITY pain-point fix)

- **`librarianDeclaration.description`** rewritten with the strict template:
  - ALL of (a) external information not in repo, (b) MULTIPLE independent
    sources or current-year answer, (c) direct tools each insufficient.
  - Explicit `DO NOT use for` denylist (≥5 cases): single URL fetch, single
    library docs lookup, single GitHub search, local-codebase questions,
    trivial facts.
  - Cost signal: ~5–10× more tokens and latency than a direct tool call.
- **Bytes overlay**: removed the loose keyword-trigger block that previously
  let phrases like `"research" / "tìm hiểu" / "tra cứu" / "investigate"`
  fire `librarian` on their own. Replaced with the same strict (a)+(b)+(c)
  gate plus an explicit "keyword triggers are NOT sufficient by themselves"
  reminder.
- **Cost signal in Session Capabilities**: every `delegate_*` call now
  carries an explicit "~5–10× more tokens and latency than a direct tool
  call — prefer direct tools when 1–2 calls suffice" warning when delegation
  is enabled.

### Phase 1.1–1.4 — Bytes overlay upgrade

- Added `identity`, `autonomy_and_persistence`, `investigate_before_acting`,
  `tool_use_protocol`, `verification_contract`,
  `executing_actions_with_care`, `markdown_format`, `file_references`,
  `final_status_spec` sections — each adapted from the Amp Smart QT4
  reference and trimmed for compactness.
- `verification_contract` introduces a typecheck → lint → test → build gate
  order, faithful-reporting rule, and explicit "do not hard-code expected
  values to satisfy a test" rule.
- `tool_use_protocol` codifies parallel tool calls, the `cwd` parameter
  rule, the `rg`-over-`grep` preference, and the "do not refer to tools by
  name in user prose" rule.
- `file_references` documents the fluent `file://` link form with
  URL-encoding rules.
- `final_status_spec` gives a 2–10 line completion report shape.

### Phase 1.5 — 4 provider variants

- `default.ts` (Claude) now wraps each section in semantic XML tags
  (`<identity>`, `<precedence>`, `<verification>`, `<engineering>`,
  `<workflow>`, `<completion>`, etc.).
- `gpt.ts` appends explicit **Verification Gates** (1. Typecheck, 2. Lint,
  3. Tests, 4. Build) and a **Parallel Execution Policy** footer.
- `gemini.ts` appends 4 worked examples (file-reference style, parallel
  tool calls, verification reporting, destructive-action gating).
- **NEW** `kimi.ts` for Kimi/Moonshot models — terse markdown,
  instruction-dense, no worked examples.
- `loader.ts` routing now covers all 5 families: `claude`, `gpt`, `gemini`,
  `kimi`, `other` (defaults to claude renderer).

### Phase 2 — Sub-agent polish

- **Explore (BREAKING)**: legacy XML output (`<results>/<files>/<answer>/
  <next_steps>`) replaced with Markdown + fluent `file://` links. New
  guidance: ≥6 parallel tool calls per turn when scope is wide, complete
  within 3 turns, prefer source code over docs, scope globs aggressively
  (`core/**/*x*` not `**/*x*`).
- **Oracle**: prepended an "IMPORTANT — Self-contained final message"
  preamble (only the last message returns to the caller). Added fluent
  `file://` link rule. Effort estimate template (Quick/Short/Medium/Large)
  preserved unchanged — that's still a strength.
- **Reviewer**: caller MUST pre-fetch with
  `git diff --merge-base origin/HEAD HEAD` and pass the diff in `context`
  (Reviewer remains read-only, no `bash`/`git` in allowlist). Added abort
  rule for >100 files / >10 K lines, abstraction-fit evaluation
  (over-/under-abstraction), and a runtime `console.warn` when
  `delegate_reviewer` is invoked with empty/short `context`.
- **General**: added a `### Hard Rules` line: "Verification gate order:
  typecheck → lint → test → build — use AGENTS.md commands; report counts
  honestly".
- **Librarian**: added Local File References section with the fluent
  `file://` link form for repo files (external citations remain on the
  GitHub permalink / official docs URL form).

### Phase 3 — UX & communication (folded into Phase 1)

- Channel separation, Markdown strict rules, and final-status spec all live
  in the Bytes overlay sections (`final_status_spec`, `markdown_format`,
  `work_defaults`).

### Phase 4 — New capabilities (deferred)

The following are scoped but not yet implemented:

- `handoff` tool (spawn nested `pi -p` with fresh context).
- `code-tour` sub-agent (read-only numbered file:line walkthrough).
- `look_at` tool (multimodal — pending Pi platform multimodal support).
- `bytes_todo` lightweight in-memory TODO list (pending Pi `task_list` API
  check).

### Tests

- 13 new tests in `src/sub-agents/__tests__/librarian-gating.test.ts`
  (description gate + overlay gate + 6 fixtures L1–L6).
- Existing `delegates.test.ts` librarian assertions updated to the new
  (a)(b)(c) + denylist contract.
- Existing `bytes-overlay.test.ts` librarian-trigger assertions updated for
  the new strict gating wording.
- `loader.test.ts` XML-tag assertion updated from `<agency>` to
  `<identity>` / `<precedence>` / `<verification>`.

### Tooling

- New `scripts/snapshot-prompts.ts` (run with `node --import tsx
  scripts/snapshot-prompts.ts`) prints per-agent + per-overlay-variant
  character / section / heading stats.

## 0.2.12 (2026-04-30)

### Added

- **Configurable `executionMode` per agent**: sub-agents can now be configured as `"sequential"` or `"parallel"` via `sub_agents.<name>.executionMode` in `settings.json` or `execution_mode` in YAML declarations. Default is `undefined` (Pi parallel), preserving the ability to run multiple `delegate_general` calls concurrently during plan/bead implementation.
- **YAML runtime overlay parity**: YAML-defined sub-agents now receive the same runtime overlay (current date, working directory, finalized tool list) as builtin agents via `prependSystemPrompt`.
- **Accurate finalized-tools snapshot**: `AgentSnapshot.allowedToolsSummary` and `fallbackEligible` are now computed from finalized tools (after applying `disabled_tools` and mutability policy) instead of raw declaration tools. Added `droppedTools` field with diagnostic breakdown.
- **Final progress details on tool result**: the `details` field (status, cost, latency, tool history, model) is now included in the final tool result, not just in progress updates. Error paths also emit `status: "failed"` details so the renderer no longer incorrectly shows them as completed.
- **Centralized secret redaction**: merged redaction patterns from `runner.ts` and `general-safety-overlay.ts` into `src/shared/redact.ts`. Setup-time error messages are now redacted before surfacing.

### Changed

- **Nested sessions skip parent overlay**: `injectPromptAugmentation()` returns the system prompt unchanged when `PI_NESTED_DEPTH >= 1`, preventing nested LLMs from seeing `delegate_*` tool references they cannot use. Nested agents already receive their own runtime overlay from `prependSystemPrompt`.

### Tests

- Added 14 new tests: redaction patterns (8), finalized-tools snapshot (3), executionMode config resolution (2), snapshot executionMode precedence (1).

## 0.2.11 (2026-04-30)

### Changed

- **Librarian activation scope**: softened the Bytes prompt overlay and `delegate_librarian` tool description to avoid over-delegating simple or local requests. Librarian is now framed for non-trivial external research that needs multiple sources, current docs/changelog verification, public code examples, library internals, or conflict reconciliation.
- **Direct lookup guidance**: simple one-hop docs/web/GitHub lookups now prefer direct tools when available, while local codebase exploration stays on local tools instead of `delegate_librarian`.

### Tests

- Updated librarian prompt regression tests to cover the narrower trigger wording and direct-tool availability guard.

## 0.2.10 (2026-04-29)

### Changed

- **Migrate `@sinclair/typebox` → `typebox`**: replaced all imports from `@sinclair/typebox` (v0.33) with the `typebox` package (v1.x) as recommended by pi docs. `typebox` is now a `peerDependency` (shared with the host pi runtime) instead of a bundled `dependency`, reducing install footprint.
- **Bump peer dependency**: `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` peer range updated from `^0.67` to `^0.69.0` (v0.69.0 introduced the `@sinclair/typebox` → `typebox` migration in its published types).

## 0.2.9 (2026-04-29)

### Added

- **Per-agent setup flow**: `/setup-models` wizard configures model and thinking level together for each agent before advancing to the next, replacing the previous two-loop flow (all models, then all thinking levels).
- **Grouped provider picker**: when more than 10 models are available, model selection uses a two-step flow — select a provider (e.g., `anthropic (8 models)`), then pick a model within that provider. Cancel at the model step returns to the provider list.
- **Batch shortcuts**: after the first agent, the wizard offers "⬆ Apply `<model>` to all remaining agents", "⬆ Apply `<level>` to all remaining agents", and "⏭ Skip thinking for all remaining agents" to reduce repetitive selections.
- **Summary confirmation**: a formatted summary table (agent → model → thinking) is displayed and confirmed before writing to `settings.json`.
- **Smart model ordering**: models selected earlier in the wizard session sort first in subsequent agent selections.
- **One-for-all reasoning modes**: when using one model for all agents, the wizard offers three reasoning sub-modes: same level for all, configure per agent, or skip.
- **Interactive `/blackbytes-status`**: the command opens an interactive section picker with a compact overview header (`Tools: N | Agents: N | Skills: N`). Users select one of 9 sections to view, or "Show All" for the full output.

### Removed

- Dead code: unused `selectAction` and `buildReasoningChoices` helper functions removed from setup-models.

### Fixed

- Summary display correctly shows existing reasoning levels for agents whose thinking configuration is skipped (previously showed "(default)" regardless).
- Provider labels in grouped picker use a reverse-lookup map, preventing theoretical label collision with static choices.

## 0.2.8 (2026-04-29)

### Added

- **Sub-agent tool activity tracking**: sub-agent progress header displays tool call count, current tool name with argument summary (`🔧 read src/config/schema.ts`), and `✓`/`✗`/`⚠` status icons for terminal states (completed/failed/cancelled/timed_out). Expanded view (`Ctrl+O`) renders a tool activity timeline showing the last 30 invocations with `✓`/`▸` icons, argument summaries, and per-call durations.
- **Extension tool result rendering**: all bundled and HTTP-backed tools (grep, glob, hashline_edit, ast_search, ast_replace, web_search, web_fetch, docs_resolve, docs_query, gh_search) render collapsed results with `✓`/`✗` status icons and display partial-state messages (`Searching...`, `Fetching...`, `Scanning...`, etc.) while executing.

### Changed

- **Tool icon deconfliction**: `web_search` uses 🌐, `web_fetch` uses 📥, and `reviewer` sub-agent uses 📋 to eliminate icon collisions with `grep` (🔍) and `gh_search` (🔎).

## 0.2.7 (2026-04-28)

### Fixed

- **Package prompt discovery**: declares bundled prompt templates in the Pi package manifest via `pi.prompts` so Pi loads the published `prompts/*.md` files as slash commands.

## 0.2.6 (2026-04-28)

### Added

- **Bundled prompt templates**: package-level prompt templates for fresh-eyes review, documentation refresh, project innovation ideation, and logical commit-and-push workflows. These templates are discovered by Pi as slash commands from the package `prompts/` directory.

## 0.2.5 (2026-04-28)

### Changed

- **Reasoning effort handling**: reasoning parameters are no longer mapped onto provider payloads in `before_provider_request`. The host session relies on Pi's native reasoning controls; sub-agent reasoning continues to be passed via the `--thinking <effort>` CLI flag.
- **`/setup-models` wizard**: skips thinking-level configuration for sub-agents whose assigned model does not advertise reasoning support.
- **Reasoning effort normalization**: invalid legacy `reasoningEffort` values in config are coerced to `undefined` rather than being forwarded to the nested Pi CLI. Only Pi-valid levels (`off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`) are accepted.

### Removed

- `src/handlers/before-provider-request.ts` and its unit tests.

## 0.2.4 (2026-04-27)

### Improved

- **Librarian sub-agent activation**: strengthened tool description and prompt overlay so the primary agent delegates external-library/docs/API research to `delegate_librarian` more readily when users request research, investigation, or lookup (including Vietnamese phrases like "tìm hiểu", "tra cứu").
- **External Content Safety**: added a safety section to the librarian system prompt treating web pages, docs, GitHub files, and fetched URLs as untrusted data — the sub-agent will not follow instructions found in external content.
- **Prompt overlay**: session capabilities and conditional workflows now include librarian-specific guidance ("Prefer `librarian` for explicit, non-trivial research requests…") that only renders when the librarian sub-agent is enabled.
- **Scoped wording**: tool description uses "non-trivial external research" with explicit escape hatches (purely local, trivial, or user opts out) to avoid over-delegation.

### Changed

- Librarian resource-metadata description updated from "Multi-repo analysis, documentation lookup" to "External docs/library/API research and open-source examples".

### Tests

- Regression test for librarian-specific overlay guidance presence/absence.
- Regression test for tool description wording guards and external-content safety section.

## 0.2.3 (2026-04-27)

### Changed

- Increased builtin sub-agent timeout defaults: explore=600000, librarian=900000, oracle=1200000, reviewer=900000, general=1800000.

## 0.2.2 (2026-04-26)

### Fixed

- Package name in README title and install command reflects the current unscoped name (`pi-blackbytes`).
- Removed non-existent `tool_description` field from YAML sub-agent example.
- Listed all optional YAML fields (`model`, `reasoning_effort`, `timeout_ms`, `mutability`, `prompt_mode`, `fallback_models`) inline in README.
- Added `reviewer=240000` to the documented `timeoutMs` builtin defaults in AGENTS.md.
- Added `yaml` to the documented dependency list in AGENTS.md.
- Added `bun run typecheck` to the documented development scripts in both README and AGENTS.md.
- Removed stale `console.log` startup banner from `src/index.ts`.

## 0.2.1 (2026-04-26)

### Added

- **Branding widget**: a gradient `✦ Bytes ✦` badge renders right-aligned above the chat input editor in interactive mode. Uses fixed 24-bit RGB colors (violet → indigo → sky → cyan) with bold text, independent of the active theme. Skipped in print mode and JSON mode.

### Internal

- New `src/branding.ts` module with gradient rendering utilities and widget setup.
- `handleSessionStart()` calls `setupBranding()` after tool and sub-agent registration.

## 0.2.0 (2026-04-26)

### Added

- **Reviewer sub-agent**: new read-only code reviewer (`delegate_reviewer`) that produces severity-classified findings (High/Medium/Low) and a verdict for diffs, branches, and PRs.
- **Runtime overlay for read-only sub-agents**: lightweight (~4 KB) `prependSystemPrompt` overlay via `buildSubAgentRuntimeOverlay()` carrying current date, working directory, and finalized tool allowlist.
- **Enhanced sub-agent tool strategies**: explore, oracle, and librarian agents now include detailed tool-strategy sections mapping question types to the best primitive tools.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow to publish to npm on release creation.

### Changed

- **Package renamed** from `@blackbytes/pi-blackbytes` to `pi-blackbytes` (unscoped).
- **Package metadata**: added `repository`, `homepage`, and `bugs` fields to `package.json`.
- Sub-agent system prompts expanded with tool-strategy guidance and runtime overlay hooks.
- CI workflow installs `ripgrep` for grep integration tests.

### Removed

- Bundled skills (`blackbytes-overview`, `hashline-workflow`, `delegation`) — replaced by enhanced sub-agent prompts and runtime overlays.


### Added

- Optional `blackbytes.system_prompt_log` JSONL capture for full Pi-effective system prompts at `agent_start`, with optional provider-serialized system-field capture at `before_provider_request`.

### Changed

- `/setup-models` now maps Blackbytes sub-agents to models already available in Pi instead of collecting provider credentials or writing provider/package defaults into the Blackbytes config.
- Extension event wrappers now await handlers and preserve return values so return-based Pi hooks such as `before_agent_start` and `tool_result` work correctly.

### Phase 2 closure summary

All five Phase 2 beads are resolved:

| Bead | Feature | Status |
|---|---|---|
| pib-vyj.2.1 | Per-agent timeout (`timeoutMs` / `timeout_ms`) | Landed |
| pib-vyj.2.2 | `promptMode` schema (`static` \| `append`) | Landed (append reserved) |
| pib-vyj.2.3 | Append prompt mode for builtins | **Deferred** (no safe Pi inherited-context API) |
| pib-vyj.2.4 | Conservative model fallback for read-only agents | Landed |
| pib-vyj.2.5 | Streaming / progress support | **Deferred** (no structured Pi progress surface) |

### Deferred to Phase 3

The following items were investigated in Phase 2 and deferred. They should not be re-opened without the stated precondition:

- **Parallel fanout / background task lifecycle** — requires a Pi API for concurrent tool execution or a stable background task surface.
- **Worktree isolation** — requires Pi to expose per-delegate working-directory control.
- **Persistent agent memory** — requires a stable, bounded Pi session-state API.
- **Streaming progress** — becomes supportable when Pi exposes a structured progress surface (typed status events, not raw stdout) with a chunk-level redaction utility available.
- **Append prompt mode** — becomes supportable when Pi exposes a `parentContext` / `inheritedInstructions` field on the tool execute callback, bounded in size and scoped to the parent's static system prompt only.



**Decision: deferred** — no builtin (`oracle`, `general`, `explore`, `librarian`) is opted into `promptMode: "append"`.
All four builtins continue to use the implicit static default. `buildSystemPrompt()` still throws fail-loud on `"append"`.

**Why deferred:** the prompt-builder bead (pib-vyj.2.2) confirmed Pi exposes no safe inherited-context source.
`AgentSession.systemPrompt` exists on the class but is unreachable from the registered tool's `execute` closure
(signature `(toolCallId, params, signal, onUpdate, ctx?)` — no parent-session reference). Without a stable,
bounded API surfacing the parent's static system prompt, enabling append mode would require either reading
arbitrary files (out of scope, unsafe) or scraping transcripts (forbidden by 2.2 source-contract rule).

**Re-evaluation criteria** (when to revisit and enable append for `oracle`, then `general` separately):
1. Pi exposes a documented `parentContext` / `inheritedInstructions` field on the tool execute callback,
   bounded in size, scoped to the parent's static system prompt only (not transcripts, not tool outputs).
2. A chunk-level secret-redaction utility is available (or `redactFailureText` is broadened with bounded
   guarantees suitable for prompt content).
3. For `general`: extra validation that append context cannot conflict with the bounded safety overlay or
   loosen the no-recursive-delegation / mutating-tools boundary.

**No code change.** This entry documents the deferral so future implementers do not silently flip
`promptMode` on a builtin without re-running the source-contract analysis.

### Phase 2 conservative model fallback for read-only agents (pib-vyj.2.4)

Adds optional `fallbackModels` config for read-only sub-agents (explore, oracle, librarian,
YAML-defined read-only agents). When a `provider_or_model_unavailable` failure is returned,
`executeWithFallback` retries with each model in the chain within a shared timeout budget.

**New / changed files:**
- `src/sub-agents/fallback.ts` — `executeWithFallback` + `formatAttempts` (pure, injectable).
- `src/config/schema.ts` — `fallbackModels` per-agent field (max 5 non-empty strings, no dupes).
- `src/sub-agents/loader.ts` — `fallback_models` in YAML schema; folded into `staticOverrides`.
- `src/sub-agents/declaration.ts` — `fallbackModels` added to `ModelOverrides`.
- `src/sub-agents/snapshot.ts` — `fallbackModels` + `fallbackEligible` fields on `AgentSnapshot`.
- `src/sub-agents/register.ts` — replaces single `runNestedPi` call with `executeWithFallback`.
- `src/commands/blackbytes-status.ts` — shows fallback chain and eligibility in snapshot section.
- `src/sub-agents/__tests__/fallback.test.ts` — new test file.

### Phase 2 progress/streaming spike (pib-vyj.2.5)

**Decision: unsupported** — live streaming of nested sub-agent output into the parent session is intentionally not wired.

**Investigation findings** (all citations from `node_modules/@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`):

- `AgentToolUpdateCallback<T>` (`pi-agent-core/dist/types.d.ts:255`):
  `(partialResult: AgentToolResult<T>) => void` — a structured callback that sends partial
  `{ content, details }` objects to the host runtime during tool execution.
- `ToolDefinition.execute` signature (`core/extensions/types.d.ts:307`): receives
  `onUpdate: AgentToolUpdateCallback<TDetails> | undefined` as a 4th parameter.
- Bash tool (`core/tools/bash.js:201–244`): proves `onUpdate` is a **pure UI streaming surface**.
  Intermediate `onUpdate` calls display partial output in the TUI; the final `execute()` return
  value is what enters the LLM context. Calling `onUpdate` does **not** append to the final
  tool result.
- `RunNestedPiOptions.onUpdate` (`src/sub-agents/types.ts`): `(chunk: string) => void`. Already
  wired internally — `runner.ts` calls `onUpdate?.(text)` on each stdout chunk (`runner.ts:238–239`).
- `register.ts:45–46`: the `execute` callback receives `_onUpdate?: unknown` (unused, `_` prefix,
  typed `unknown`). Never forwarded to `runNestedPi`.

**Why streaming remains unsupported:**

1. Nested-Pi stdout is the full agent conversation (reasoning, tool calls, results) — too verbose
   to surface in the parent TUI without filtering.
2. No chunk-level secret redaction exists on the streaming path (`redactFailureText` only
   covers failure detail strings).
3. Wiring raw stdout through `onUpdate` would dump the nested conversation into the parent
   visual context, violating the "do not dump nested stdout into parent context" design constraint.

**What would make streaming supportable:** a structured progress surface from Pi (typed status events
rather than raw stdout), or a nested-session `--json-progress` mode producing concise, filterable
events, combined with a chunk-level redaction utility.

**Code changes:** JSDoc added to `RunNestedPiOptions.onUpdate` in `src/sub-agents/types.ts`
explaining the internal-only contract. README gained a "Progress / streaming" section documenting
the decision. No behavioral change; `bun run lint && bun run build && bun run test` all pass.

### Phase 2 prompt-mode schema (pib-vyj.2.2)

- **`promptMode` field on `SubAgentDeclaration`** (`src/sub-agents/declaration.ts`): optional `"static" | "append"` discriminator. Default is `"static"`. Field is frozen with the declaration via `defineSubAgent()`.
- **YAML `prompt_mode` field** (`src/sub-agents/loader.ts`): Zod enum validates `"static"` and `"append"`; any other value is rejected as a schema error and produces a diagnostic through the existing YAML pipeline (file skipped, reason surfaced in `/blackbytes-status`). Omitting the field defaults to `undefined` (static by default).
- **`buildSystemPrompt()` function** (`src/sub-agents/prompt-builder.ts`): centralised system-prompt assembler. In `"static"` mode (default) returns `basePrompt` byte-for-byte unchanged — no trimming, no transformation. In `"append"` mode throws a clear `Error` immediately ("not yet supported") so the delegate tool call fails loudly. **Append mode is deferred to pib-vyj.2.3**: Pi's `ExtensionAPI` execute callback exposes only `(toolCallId, params, signal, onUpdate, ctx?)` — there is no stable, bounded API that returns the parent session's static system prompt from within a registered tool. `AgentSession.systemPrompt` exists on the class but is unreachable from the execute closure without unsafe global state. Until Pi surfaces a supported `parentContext` field, append mode stays deferred.
- **`register.ts` wired to `buildSystemPrompt()`**: replaced inline `systemPrompt` variable with `baseSystemPrompt` → `buildSystemPrompt({ basePrompt, declaration })` → `builtPrompt`. Static mode output is byte-for-byte identical to previous behaviour.
- **No builtin sets `promptMode`**: all four builtins (`explore`, `oracle`, `librarian`, `general`) continue to operate with the implicit static default.
- **Tests** (`src/sub-agents/__tests__/prompt-builder.test.ts`, additions to `loader.test.ts`): snapshot tests confirm each builtin's system prompt is unchanged through the builder; append-mode tests verify the error message content and road-map citation; YAML schema tests confirm valid/invalid `prompt_mode` values are accepted/rejected; register.ts integration tests pass unmodified (zero behaviour change in static mode).

### Phase 1 subagent hardening

- **Canonical delegable tool registry + finalizer** (`src/sub-agents/delegable-tools.ts`): explicit tool classes (`EXTENSION_TOOL_NAMES`, `PI_BUILTIN_TOOLS`, `READ_SEARCH_DOCS_TOOLS`, `MUTATING_EXEC_TOOLS`). `finalizeNestedTools` pipeline: dedupe → reject delegate\_\*/unknown (strict throws / lenient drops) → apply global `disabled_tools` denylist → enforce per-agent mutability → sort. Strict mode for builtins, lenient for YAML.
- **Tool resolvers fixed for builtins + YAML**: explore/oracle/librarian are read-only/research-only with strict mode; general has full-access (Pi built-ins + extension tools) with strict mode and a prepended bounded safety overlay. YAML default starting set is `READ_SEARCH_DOCS` only. YAML `allowed_tools` listing any mutating tool auto-promotes mutability to `full-access`. Optional YAML `mutability:` field. Globally-disabled tools never reach nested Pi.
- **General safety overlay** (`src/sub-agents/general-safety-overlay.ts`): bounded ~8 KB markdown overlay listing cwd, finalized tools, enabled/disabled resources, hard rules, and AGENTS.md-derived constraints (truncated, with secret redaction).
- **Temperature RESERVED**: Pi CLI does not accept `--temperature`. Schema accepts the field for forward-compat; runner never emits it. `/blackbytes-status` surfaces it under "Reserved / Unsupported Settings".
- **Per-agent config snapshot** (`src/sub-agents/snapshot.ts`): resolved once at `session_start`. Precedence: declaration staticOverrides < YAML < JSON. `AgentSnapshot` includes `name`, `source` (`'builtin'|'yaml'`), `sourcePath?`, `model?`, `reasoningEffort?`, `reserved`, `extra`, `allowedToolsSummary`. Disk changes after `session_start` do not affect the active session.
- **Idempotent session start** (`src/shared/session-state.ts`): `resetSessionRuntimeState()` clears EnabledSet, agent snapshot, sub-agent registry, model-family cache, and YAML diagnostics as the very first step in `handleSessionStart`.
- **YAML diagnostics + safe status output** (`src/sub-agents/diagnostics.ts`): YAML loader returns `{declarations, diagnostics}`. Conflicts (vs builtin or earlier YAML) are skipped with a diagnostic instead of throwing; non-conflicting agents in the same directory still load. `/blackbytes-status` renders new sections: **Sub-Agent Snapshot** (allowed tools summary, source, model/reasoning, reserved, extra) and **YAML Sub-Agents** (loaded files + skipped files with reasons).
- **Failure formatting / cancellation / bounded output**: runner exposes `formatDelegateFailure`, `classifyFailure`, `redactFailureText` with failure kinds: `failed`, `timed_out`, `cancelled`, `spawn_error`, `recursion_refused`, `cli_usage_error`, `invalid_tool_allowlist`, `provider_or_model_unavailable`.

## 0.1.0 (2026-04-18)

### Release surface

- Bundled local tools: `glob`, `grep`, `ast_grep_search`, `ast_grep_replace`, `hashline_edit`
- HTTP-backed tools: `websearch_search`, `websearch_fetch`, `context7_resolve_library_id`, `context7_query_docs`, `grep_app_search_github`
- Delegate tools: `delegate_explore`, `delegate_oracle`, `delegate_librarian`, `delegate_general`
- Pi commands: `/setup-models`, `/blackbytes-status`
- Bundled skills: `blackbytes-overview`, `hashline-workflow`, `delegation`

### Runtime behavior

- The enabled tool/sub-agent set is computed once at `session_start` and reused across registration and prompt augmentation.
- `before_agent_start` injects the Bytes prompt block and the current `<available_resources>` view.
- `tool_result` rewrites Pi `read` and `write` output for the hashline workflow.
- `before_provider_request` maps reasoning settings by model family and registers the GitHub Copilot initiator header when enabled.
- Delegate sessions run with runtime-enforced tool allowlists and a one-level recursion guard.

### Configuration

- Strict JSON configuration under `settings.json › blackbytes`
- Tool and sub-agent disabling via `disabled_tools` and `disabled_sub_agents`
- Websearch provider selection via `websearch.provider` with `exa_api_key` or `tavily_api_key`
- Optional Context7 API key under `context7.api_key`
- Per-agent overrides under `sub_agents.<name>`

### Constraints

- Node `>=20`
- Peer dependency: `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent@^0.67`
- Package budget: `< 500KB` gzipped
